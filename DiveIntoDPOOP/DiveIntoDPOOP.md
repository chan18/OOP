# Basics of OOP

OOP is a paradigm based on the concept of 
wrapping pieces of data, and behavior related to that data, 
into special bundles called objects,

which are constructed from set of `blueprints`, called classes.

`
    class

    name

    fields - state
    * visibility

    methods - behavior

`


data stored inside object `fields` is referenced as `state`.
all the objects methods define its `behavior`


so `classes` is like a `blueprint` that defines the `structure` for `objects`,
which are `concrete` instances of that class.


# class hierarchies

classes are organized in class hierarchies.

superclass or parentclass or baseclass
subclass or derivedclass


Class relationships 

arrows with empty trainalge heads indicate `inheritance` 
always go from subclass to superclass.

subclass can override the default behavior of methods that they inherit  from parent classes.
or just enhance it.
